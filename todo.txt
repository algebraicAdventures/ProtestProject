programming stuff:
Audio for cellphone works (text notification and call)
	want to wait to put things onto actuall cell phone object
update texts accordingly
	need cell text things
Officer assignment has mechanical effect on game (change situation value)
	talk to carol about what it should be
Player Choices
	set up dialogue UI to handle that stuff
Add in more decisions for the player to react to
	this will require more code to make the UI for that appear and look not terrible
	
**dialogue buttons do things**
	
general unity stuff:	
game is in the office we built
	make a scene in unity with it

Assets needed:
Officer assignment UI stuff
	need officer assign pushed as image
Buttons for dialogue stuff
	Next message button, buttons for choice A or B
		A or B buttons should have no text on them but will have text in the game depending on situation

Transitions from day to day
	fade out or screen goes straight to black

Names for officer, player, son, wife, mayor, politician, ??
	
add 7th officer, remove when fire event occurs????

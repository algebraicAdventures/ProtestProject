Audio for cellphone works (text notification and call)
	want to wait to put things onto actuall cell phone object
game is in the office we built
	make a scene in unity with it
update newspaper accordingly
	need newspapers as images rather than illustrator things
update texts accordingly
	need cell text things
desktop UI that splits into news/twitter
	need the ui icons as seperate pictures rather than one flat image
fonts and colors for dialogue
	what should be the colors, fonts, and sized of the text?
Officer assignment UI stuff
	need officer assign pushed as image
Officer assignment has mechanical effect on game (change situation value)
	talk to carol about what it should be
Transitions from day to day
	fade out or screen goes straight to black


Add in more decisions for the player to react to
	this will require more code to make the UI for that appear and look not terrible
